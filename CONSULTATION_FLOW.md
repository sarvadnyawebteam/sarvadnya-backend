# Find Solution: Strategic Consultation Engine

This document defines the logic, flow, and knowledge base for the interactive consultation engine located at `/find-solution`.

## Overview
The "Find Solution" engine is a multi-step questionnaire designed to analyze a business's current state, industry, and scale to provide a prioritized strategic roadmap. It uses a combination of logic-based branching and AI-driven analysis.

## 3. Analysis Logic (Strategic Rules)

The AI Analyst (Senior Strategic Unit) follows these internal rules when generating the roadmap:

1. **Precision Rule:** If recommending "TDL Customization", it must be descriptive and industry-specific (e.g., "Brokerage Commission Reconciliation TDL").
2. **Category Prioritization:** Recommendations are categorized into CORE SOFTWARE, CLOUD, SECURITY, AUTOMATION (TDL), MOBILE, COMPLIANCE, and TRAINING.
3. **Priority Levels:** CRITICAL, HIGH, or STRATEGIC.
4. **Collective Voice:** Uses "We recommend" or "Our Unit suggests" for professional authority.
5. **Sanitization:** Automatically strips all markdown markers (asterisks, bold markers) for a clean UI presentation.

## 4. Visual & Theme Architecture

The consultation engine is built on the "Deep Blue" and "Radiant Sky" brand identity:
- **Primary Colors:** Bright Blue (`#00ABE4`), Deep Blue (`#0371a3`), Midnight (`#0f172a`).
- **Foundations:** Pure White (`#ffffff`) with Sky Blue tints (`#f0f9ff`, `#e0f2fe`).
- **Interactive States:** High-contrast borders, shadow-elevated cards, and smooth HSLA-based atmospheric blobs for cinematic depth.
- **Density:** High-density "Dashboard" aesthetic with scaled-down interactive elements for vertical efficiency.

## 5. Admin Integration & Lead Capture

### Lead Implementation Protocol
When a user clicks "Ready for Growth?", a specialized **Lead Capture Modal** is activated:
- **Data Points:** Full Name, Work Email, Phone Number, Business Name.
- **Validation:** Strict numeric enforcement for phone numbers (allows only digits and '+').
- **Submission:** Results are bundled with the user's answers and AI advice and sent to `/api/contact`.

### Admin Dashboard Traceability
- **Submissions Hub:** All consultation leads are automatically stored in the `form_submissions` collection.
- **Real-Time Stats:** The Admin Dashboard (`/admin`) tracks these leads under the "Submissions" stat card.
- **Inspection:** Administrators can view the full strategic roadmap and questionnaire history within the Submissions management interface.
